# DelRepo

At a time in my coding life, especialy in the journey learning about Git/Github. I suddenly realized my profile has a lot of repositories that must be removed. 

However, deleting each repo one by one is quite a time-consuming task. So I begun finding the way that can save my time and I know about API, specifically Github API.

This project is one of the first application that I using API technology. It can help you remove many repositories in one click, save a lot of your time.
